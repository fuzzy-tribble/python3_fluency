# About

{{ site.description | escape }}

# Developer Details

This is a GitHub Pages site built from the following repo

```
https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/python3_fluency
```

## Build Theme
The theme is [minima-ipynb](https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/minima-ipynb) an adaptation of minima for displaying Jupyter Notebooks.

## Build Source
This content for this site is directly built from the `notebooks` directory of [this repo](https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/python3_fluency) using [nbconvertjkl](https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/nbconvertjkl) build script which updates the site folder (`/docs`) accordingly for GitHub Pages (Jekyll) to serve.

# Site Updates
If errors or other concerns are brough to my attention I update the notebooks and rerun the build script so the site gets updated also.
