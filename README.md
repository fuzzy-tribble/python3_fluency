**Want to create an site from your ipython notebooks like this?**

This is just a GitHub pages site that uses the [minima-ipynb theme](https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/minima-ipynb) and is built using [`nbconvertjkl`](https://github.com/fuzzy-tribble/nbconvertjkl) python package to build the content from the `notebooks` folder!
